# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #3
## Subject
_Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve._

## Mandatory Objectives
* Draw few lines of different colors and weights
* Draw a Bezier curve
* Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
* Draw 2 different objects using mouse

## Bonus Objectives

[x] Draw a custom bitmap image (1 pt) 
* Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects (2 pt)
* Draw a Bezier curve using mouse (1 pt)
* Fill an object with a gradient (1 pt)
* Delete objects using mouse clicking (2 pt)
*Use mouse as an eraser of:
 - a fixed width (1 pt)
 - a adjustable width (2 pt)
* Zoom in and out application working area using keyboard (2 pt)

## Result
* The colored button on the top opens a Color Picker Dialog, where the user can change the pen color
* In the width Combo Box you can change the line and eraser width 
* The shapes combo box, here you can choose what type of shape you want to use, so here you can find rectangle, line, ellipse, eraser and bezier curve
(you can draw bezier curve with the mouse, it uses 4 points)
 * And the last combo box is for filling mode, figure can be filled, unfilled or with the gradient
 * Clear button used for clearing the screen
 * Save button used for saving your image to a bitmap image in your computer;

  ## Conclusion
  In this laboratory work, I've learned some new basic features used in event driven programming as, dialog boxes, list boxes, menus, scroll bars,
  icons, cursors and others. A little bit confusing was the process of making the dialog box, because it needs another procedure and their structures
  can be made using resources. Another challenge were the scrollbars, especially the case when you have multiple horizontal scroll bars,
  responsible for different processes, but you can use only one window message: WM_HSCROLL.
  In general by solving all tasks, my skills in EDP has increased, so that now I understand how to use all these basic elements.
